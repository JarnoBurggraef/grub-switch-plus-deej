I currently still have a few dozen Rev.B  PCBs collecting dust.
If you'd like one or two instead of triggering your own PCB order,
I can mail them to you.

First, send me an email at
  grubswitch@gmail.com
to check if this is still true and whether I can get it to you
cheaply (i.e. postage).

I have kept all Rev.B files here in the _legacy_RevB folder;
the only differences to Rev.C are:

* A moved /BINARY_MODE pin (therefore, there are separate *REVB*
  hex images and header files in 2_usb_device)

* No pads for the smaller VQFN44-packages (*-MU codes)

* No contact pads for an AVR ISP programmer
  (required for VQFN44 b/c they have no bootloader)

* /HWB signal is at the wrong pin. If you ever want to reflash
  the chip with a new HEX image, you'll have to solder one wire
  to fix this (see section 4.1 of
  _legacy_RevB/documentation/3_custom_hardware.pdf)

Cheers,
