OS-prober change in GRUB version 2.06 (included in Ubuntu 22.04)
================================================================

The problem
-----------

Starting with GRUB v2.06 released this year, calling

>  update-grub

which builds the /boot/grub/grub.cfg script and therefore the
GRUB boot menu, doesn't run a helper script called
"*_os-prober"  anymore; this script was responsible for
including Windows entries in the GRUB boot menu.
This is ostensibly for security reasons. I can't speak to that,
but on private multi-boot PCs, it is surely a damn nuisance.

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS has, reasonably, updated to Grub 2.06,
originally following the policy of not running os-prober.

With a lot of confused people not finding Windows anymore in
their boot menu, they have, for now, implemented a workaround.
os-prober  is run during the first post-installation boot, and
if it finds a Windows installation, it's called on subsequent
runs. Since this seems unreliable and maybe prone to change,
I recommend applying the fix below pre-emptively.


The fix
-------

Make sure that  os-prober  is installed with

>  sudo apt-get install os-prober
(or whatever your OS with GRUB 2.06 uses for package install)

It's likely already there, but can't hurt to make sure.

Open the root-owned "/etc/default/grub" file and add the line
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false

for example with

> sudo nano /etc/default/grub

And afterwards run  update-grub  at least once with

> sudo update-grub

before using our GRUB SWITCH command-line tools. Done, fixed!
