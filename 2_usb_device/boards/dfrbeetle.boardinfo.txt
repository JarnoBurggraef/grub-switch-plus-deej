PROGRAMMING DFRobot Beetle WITH PREBUILT FIRMWARE (LINUX)
=========================================================

The GRUB Switch repository contains a prebuilt firmware image for the
DFRobot Beetle, which you can find under:

grub-switch/2_usb_device/prebuilt_images/GRUB_SWITCH_DFR_BEETLE.hex

To program the Beetle under Linux, you need to install the command-line
tool "avrdude". We have provided a bash script to facilitate programming on
most PCs with a few simple steps:


* Make sure that "avrdude" has been installed, for example in Ubuntu Linux with

  > sudo apt-get install avrdude


* Connect the board to USB if you haven't already.


* Go to the images path, for example from  grub-switch/  with

  > cd  2_usb_device/prebuilt_images/


* Start the script with:

  > sudo ./program_grubswitch_avrdude.sh GRUB_SWITCH_DFR_BEETLE.hex

  (sudo might not be required on every machine, but doesn't hurt)


* The script asks you to put the board into bootloader mode. The Beetle has
  a group of 6 tiny pads on the bottom side below its USB connector:

    1 3 5
    # O O    (Pad number 1 is square, not round)
    O O O
    2 4 6
  
  Short the two adjacent round pads number 5 and 6 twice in short order with
  a wire to put Beetle into bootloader mode.


* The chip enters bootloader mode and remains in it for about 5-10 secs,
  then returns to normal program operation.


* Make sure to press any key inside this time margin to commence flashing
  the firmware image onto the chip.
  
  
* After successful programming, the board should reconnect as a flash drive
  with the name "BOOTTHIS". Your Linux GUI might auto-mount the drive or offer
  to do so.


* If you have previously used the configuration tool "CONFIGURE_GRUBswitch.sh"
  to generate a GRUB Switch configuration (grub-switch/bootfiles/.entries.txt),
  you can copy this file onto the drive yourself, or you can use option "4" in
  the  CONFIGURE_GRUBswitch  menu to auto-mount, copy and unmount the drive.


Some background information on "avrdude", in case the script didn't work:
(or if you just want to know...)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When putting the board into bootloader mode, it will identify as a USB UART,
usually as  /dev/ttyACM0 . You can check by date if a special tty has just
turned up:

> ls -l /dev/tty* | grep "/dev/tty[^S0-9]"

Remember that the bootloader will yield to the regular board program after
a few seconds and the tty device will be gone again.

During the bootloader time, avrdude can contact the bootloader for programming:

> avrdude -v -F -p atmega32u4 -c avr109 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -Uflash:w:FIRMWARE.hex:i

For more details, try the avrdude manual with

> man avrdude



SWITCH CONNECTIONS
==================

1-OF-N MODE  with  ON/OFF/ON toggle switch:
-------------------------------------------

To choose this mode, pin PB6 needs to stay UNCONNECTED.

The Write Protect against modifying boot entry configurations is activated
by tieing/jumpering pin PB7 to GND.

Using a three-position on/off/on switch permits choosing between two
OS options, while the neutral middle position leads to the GRUB menu

1-OF-N MODE with rotary switch: (Motto: "This one goes to 11!")
---------------------------------------------------------------

To choose this mode, pin PB6 needs to stay UNCONNECTED.

The Write Protect against modifying boot entry configurations is activated
by tieing/jumpering pin PB7 to GND.

Common rotary switches have up to 12 positions (some can be limited to fewer
positions with a mechanical keyring). Keeping the first position [0] unconnected
permits choosing the GRUB menu and in principle leaves 11 boot choices, however
Beetle only has 8 accessible connection points left, side pads PB5..BF5 for
positions [1]..[4] and the PCB bottom pads PD0..PD3 for positions [5]..[8]
Connecting one of those pads to GND through the switch reflects the boot
choices 1..8. Accidentally connecting multiple pins results in the lowest-order
entry being chosen.

BINARY MODE:
------------

To choose this mode, pin PB6 needs to be tied to GND.

The Write Protect against modifying boot entry configurations is activated
by tieing/jumpering pin PB7 to GND.

Common binary-encoding rotary switches have 10 to 16 positions and connect
the corresponding bit values 1,2,4,8 [LSB..MSB] to the 'C'-contacts; using the
device's binary mode means tieing the four pins PB5..PF5 [LSB..MSB] to GND/0V
as to encode the corresponding boot choices 0(GRUB Menu) up to 15(0xF).
Obviously a proper nerd can also use four separate switches to encode the
choice in binary herself!
(Reminder: The device interprets a pin tied to GND as a '1', so all four
connections mean choice 15/0xF, while no connection means 0.
