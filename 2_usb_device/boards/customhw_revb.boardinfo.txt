PROGRAMMING GRUB SWITCH CUSTOM HW REV.B  WITH PREBUILT FIRMWARE (LINUX)
=======================================================================

The GRUB Switch repository contains a prebuilt firmware image for GRUB Switch
Custom HW (Rev.B) which you can find under:

grub-switch/2_usb_device/prebuilt_images/GRUB_SWITCH_CUSTOMHW_REVB.hex

To program the GRUB Switch Custom HW under Linux, you need to install
the command-line tool "dfu-programmer". We have provided a bash script to
facilitate programming on most PCs with a few simple steps:


* Make sure that "dfu-programmer" has been installed, for example in Ubuntu Linux with

  > sudo apt-get install dfu-programmer


* Connect the board to USB if you haven't already.


* Go to the images path, for example from  grub-switch/  with

  > cd  2_usb_device/prebuilt_images/


* Start the script with:

  > sudo ./program_grubswitch_dfu.sh  GRUB_SWITCH_CUSTOMHW_REVB.hex

  (sudo might not be required on every machine, but doesn't hurt)


* The script asks you to put the board into bootloader mode. For the Custom HW
  board, this is accomplished by pressing the board's PROG button. The chip
  resets and reconnects as a DFU class USB device.


* Press any key to commence flashing the firmware image onto the chip.
  
  
* After successful programming, the board should reconnect as a flash drive
  with the name "BOOTTHIS". Your Linux GUI might auto-mount the drive or offer
  to do so.


* If you have previously used the configuration tool "CONFIGURE_GRUBswitch.sh"
  to generate a GRUB Switch configuration (grub-switch/bootfiles/.entries.txt),
  you can copy this file onto the drive yourself, or you can use option "4" in
  the  CONFIGURE_GRUBswitch  menu to auto-mount, copy and unmount the drive.


Some background information on programming, in case the script didn't work:
(or if you just want to know...)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When putting the ATmega32u4 chip into DFU bootloader mode, it will connect and
identify as "Atmel Corp. atmega32u4 DFU bootloader" with VID 03eb, PID 2ff4.
Calling the  lsusb  tool will show both this information as well as (decimal)
bus and device numbers, for example:

> lsusb
(...other USB devices...)
Bus 002 Device 017: ID 03eb:2ff4 Atmel Corp. atmega32u4 DFU bootloader
(...other USB devices...)

Caution: The device number changes everytime the chip reconnects.

The bus and device number must be used - without leading zeroes - to invoke
"dfu-programmer". First, the current flash programming should be erased:

> dfu-programmer  atmega32u4:2,17  erase --force

(sudo might be required on your installation)

The actual programming is initiated with

> dfu-programmer  atmega32u4:2,17  flash FIRMWARE.hex

(remember that 2,17 are only examples for the bus and device numbers)

The device can be induced to restart and reconnect with the flash programming:

> dfu-programmer  atmega32u4:2,17  launch


If you have programmed a device with the GRUB Switch firmware, it should
identify with VID 1209, PID 2015 and likely the device name "InterBiometrics",
which is the company that donated the 1209 USB ID range for community use:

> lsusb
Bus 002 Device 018: ID 1209:2015 InterBiometrics


For more details, try the dfu-programmer manual with

> man dfu-programmer



SWITCH CONNECTIONS
==================

The GRUB Switch Custom HW has been designed to directly mount some common
rotary and toggle switches in 1-of-n mode, so no extra wiring is required.
See

  grub-switch/3_custom_hardware/

and

  grub-switch/documentation/3_custom_hardware.pdf

for complete component placement information.
